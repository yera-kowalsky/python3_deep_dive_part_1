"""
Garbage collection is implemented in Python in two ways: reference counting and generational. When the reference count
of an object reaches 0, reference counting garbage collection algorithm cleans up the object immediately.If you have a cycle,
reference count doesnâ€™t reach zero, you wait for the generational garbage collection  algorithm to run and clean the object
