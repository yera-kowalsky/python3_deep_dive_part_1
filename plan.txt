*******2_variables_and_memory*******
memory variables really are
memory management
reference counting/garbage collection
dynamic vs static typing
mutability vs immutability
shared references
variable equality
everything is object
garbage collection(gc): circular references, __del__(destorying object)
static typing vs dynamic typing:
"""We can use the bulit-in type() function to determine the type of the object currently referenced by a variable!!!"""
"""Python looks up the object my_var is referencing(pointing to), and returns the type of the object at that memory location!!!"""
Examples:
my_var is just a reference
my_var = 'hello'
The variable my_var is purely a reference to a string object with value hello
my_var = 10
The variable my_var is pointing to an integer object with value 10
